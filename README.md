## Overview

The Cognitive Neuroscience Organization is dedicated to advancing our understanding of brain-behavior relationships through cutting-edge research, tool development, and educational initiatives. Our repository serves as a central hub for our projects, datasets, analysis pipelines, and educational resources in the field of cognitive neuroscience.

Our interdisciplinary team combines expertise in neuroscience, psychology, computer science, and statistics to develop innovative approaches for studying the neural mechanisms underlying cognitive processes such as perception, attention, memory, language, and decision-making.

## Repository Contents

This repository is organized into several main components:

| Directory | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `/projects` | Research projects with replicable analysis pipelines |
| `/tools` | Custom software tools for neuroimaging and data analysis |
| `/datasets` | Curated datasets and references to public neuroscience data |
| `/tutorials` | Educational materials and hands-on guides |
| `/publications` | References and materials related to our published work |
| `/documentation` | Comprehensive documentation for all resources |

## Featured Projects

### NeuroBridge

An advanced platform for discovering long-tail neuroimaging data, incorporating ontology-based search with natural language text-mining approaches. This tool facilitates identification of papers and datasets relevant to specific research questions in neuroimaging[2].

### Flexible Annotation Atlas

A customizable framework for brain region annotation that allows researchers to combine and divide brain structures while maintaining anatomical hierarchy. This tool addresses the challenge of inconsistent regions-of-interest definitions across studies[5].

### Aesthetic Experience Framework

A computational model for understanding aesthetic appreciation based on the integration of sensory-motor, emotion-valuation, and meaning-knowledge neural systems. This project investigates how the brain computes aesthetic value across different stimuli[10][16].

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

```
Python 3.8+
R 4.0+
FSL or SPM for neuroimaging analysis
```

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Exios66/Cog_Neuroscience_Organization.git

# Navigate to the repository
cd Cog_Neuroscience_Organization

# Create and activate virtual environment
python -m venv env
source env/bin/activate  # On Windows: env\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage Example

```python
from cog_neuro.imaging import preprocess
from cog_neuro.analysis import functional_connectivity

# Load sample dataset
data = preprocess.load_dataset('sample_fmri_data.nii.gz')

# Preprocess the data
preprocessed_data = preprocess.standard_pipeline(data, 
                                               motion_correction=True,
                                               spatial_smoothing=True,
                                               temporal_filtering=True)

# Compute functional connectivity matrix
fc_matrix = functional_connectivity.compute_correlation_matrix(preprocessed_data, 
                                                             atlas='harvard_oxford')

# Visualize the connectivity matrix
functional_connectivity.plot_matrix(fc_matrix)
```
