# NeuroBridge

An advanced platform for discovering long-tail neuroimaging data, incorporating ontology-based search with natural language text-mining approaches.

## Project Overview

NeuroBridge facilitates the identification of papers and datasets relevant to specific research questions in neuroimaging. It combines ontology-based search with natural language processing to improve the discovery of neuroimaging data that might otherwise be difficult to find.

## Key Features

- **Ontology-Based Search**: Utilizes structured knowledge representations to enhance search capabilities
- **Natural Language Text-Mining**: Applies NLP techniques to extract relevant information from papers
- **Cross-Dataset Integration**: Connects data across multiple neuroimaging repositories
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Provides an intuitive interface for researchers to find relevant data

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- Docker (for containerized deployment)
- Access to neuroimaging datasets

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Exios66/Cog_Neuroscience_Organization.git
cd Cog_Neuroscience_Organization/projects/NeuroBridge
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Configure the database connection:

```bash
cp config.example.yml config.yml
# Edit config.yml with your database credentials
```

4. Run the setup script:

```bash
python setup.py
```

## Usage

### Basic Search

```python
from neurobridge import NeuroBridgeClient

# Initialize the client
client = NeuroBridgeClient()

# Search for studies related to a concept
results = client.search("working memory")

# Print the results
for result in results:
    print(f"Title: {result.title}")
    print(f"Authors: {result.authors}")
    print(f"DOI: {result.doi}")
    print(f"Dataset: {result.dataset_url}")
    print("---")
```

### Advanced Search with Ontology Terms

```python
from neurobridge import NeuroBridgeClient, OntologyTerm

# Initialize the client
client = NeuroBridgeClient()

# Define ontology terms
terms = [
    OntologyTerm("working memory", "COGPO:00123"),
    OntologyTerm("prefrontal cortex", "UBERON:0000451")
]

# Search with ontology terms
results = client.search_with_ontology(terms)

# Filter results by modality
fmri_results = results.filter(modality="fMRI")
```
